CSCI2270 Final Project


Project Summary:
  This project will implement a spell-checking function along with an operations counter to compare various methods of data storage and retreival.  A dictionary (provided in an accompanying file) will be read in and stored in two or three different data structures, such as a linked list, a binary search tree, and a hash table.  The user will have the option to manually add, edit, or delete words from the dictionary in memory (not the accompanying text file.)  Basic functionality will consist of the user entering a word to be checked, and the program searching the various data structures for the word, while keeping an operations count.  If the word is found, the user is notified of correct spelling and how many operations were performed to find the word in each of the competing data structures.  If the word is not found, the user will be asked if they would like spelling suggestions.  Provided suggestions will be determined by using a 'fat finger' assumption.  For example, if the user searches for 'cjicken', the word 'chicken' will be suggested, as the 'k' and 'j' keys are adjacent to each other.  Grammar, parts of speach, character reversal, etc. will not be considered.  The user will be provided with suggestions, as well as the operations count.
  
  How to Run:
    This program will be menu driven, with a main menu providing options for adding, editing, and deleting words, as well as spell-checking.  If no match is found for a given word, the user will be asked if she would like spelling suggestions.
    
  Dependencies:
    This program will not require any libraries not already a part of C++11.
  
  System requirements:
    This program will be written for Ubuntu running under Oracle VirtualBox, as provided by the University of Colorado Boulder Computer Science department for 2015 spring semester (cu-cs-vm-spring15-xfce-x64.)  Functionality in OS X and Windows environments is assumed, but not guaranteed.
